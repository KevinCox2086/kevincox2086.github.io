            <h2>What You Need For Classes</h2>
            <div id="content2">
                <p>Many of the tools you will need are relatively simple. The two most basic are the
                    hammer and anvil.</p>
                <p>The anvil can be the most difficult thing to track down these days.
                    The prices of well-made anvils has skyrocketed to anywhere between five to seven dollars
                    a pound. Starting out we are looking for something around the 65 pound or more range if
                    we can find it for a reasonable price. While we all may want to start out with a 200 pound
                    anvil for most that isn't financially feasible, and you don't even know if you are going to
                    enjoy doing this yet. The first affordable anvil I came across was the Central Forge 55lb
                    cast iron anvil at Harbor Freight. This anvil is often called an anvil shaped object by
                    the blacksmithing community at large due to its unsuitability for most forging. Since
                    this anvil is not made of hardened steel it is going to be to soft to work with efficiently.
                    I ended up returning this anvil and began looking for alternatives that would hold up better
                    over time. Then it came to my attention that Harbor Freight had released a proper cast steel
                    anvil that weighed in at 65lbs. While I checked out reviews about it I discovered that this
                    Doyle anvil would be the perfect starter anvil for me that wouldn't have to cost an arm and
                    a leg.</p>

        Who We Are

      <p>
        We at BlackThumb Forge look forward to not just making handmade items for you but also<br>
        teaching you how to do it yourself.  You will be coming along on our own journey of<br>learning.
        While we are learning this time honored skill you can as well.

        What We Do
      </b></p>
      <p>
        Here at BlackThumb Forge we are at the beginning phases of getting opened up and started.<br>
        You will come along with us on this journey of learning a new skill.<br>
        </p>
      <p><b>
        What You Need
      </b></p>
      <p>
        Many of the tools you will need are relatively simple. The two most basic are the<br>
        hammer and anvil.
      </p>
      <p>  
        The anvil can be the most difficult thing to track down these days.<br>
        The prices of well made anvils has skyrocketed to anywhere between five to seven dollars<br>
        a pound.  Starting out we are looking for something around the 65 pound or more range if<br>
        we can find it for a reasonable price.  While we all may want to start out with a 200 pound<br>
        anvil for most that isn't financially feasible and you don't even know if you are going to<br>
        enjoy doing this yet.  The first affordable anvil I came across was the Central Forge 55lb<br>
        cast iron anvil at Harbor Freight.  This anvil is often called an anvil shaped object by<br>
        the blacksmithing commounity at large due to its unsuitability for most forging. Since<br>
        this anvil is not made of hardened steel it is going to be to soft to work with efficiently.<br>
        I ended up returning this anvil and began looking for alternatives tat would hold up better<br>
        over time.  Then it came to my attention that Harbor Freight had released a proper cast steel<br>
        anvil that weighed in at 65lbs.  While I checked out reviews about it I discovered that this<br>
        Doyle anvil would be the perfect starter anvil for me that wouldn't have to cost an arm and<br>
        a leg.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The hammer is going to be one of the easier things for you to go out and find.<br>
        Most blacksmithing hammers will range in weight from 2 to 4 pounds and maybe a few that will<br>
        be even heavier.  The important thing to remember here is that starting with a heavier<br>
        hammer will not necessarily get you the result that you are looking for.  It is far more<br>
        difficult to maintain control of a heavier hammer than a lighter one when we are just<br>
        starting out.  Trying to use a hammer that is to heavy will lead to you being worn out faster<br>
        or possibly even injuring yourself or possibly even damage the anvil our the piece you are<br>
        working on.  It is far better start with a smaller hammer and learn to control it rather<br>
        than start with a larger hammer and get frustrated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next set of items that you will want to consider is clothing and accessories.<br>
        Clothing is important because while you may get burned at some point being able to<br>
        minimize the damage done will be best.  Stick to natural fibers such as cotton and<br>
        leather.  Synthetic fabrics will possibly melt and stick to you which could make a bad<br>
        day that much worse.  Leather is an ideal covering because it will provide essentially a<br>
        second skin that won't usually burn you.  A not of warning about gloves.  If you chose to<br>
        wear gloves while forging never wear a glove on your hammer hand as the hammer could<br>
        slip loose while you are swinging it.  The other warning is that make sure the gloves come<br>
        off of your hands quickly and easily.  The reason is that by the time the glove gets hot<br>
        enough that you can feel it burning you don't want your hand to be stuck inside a tight<br>
        leather glove that is quickly turning into an oven.  A leather apron of some kind will<br>
        serve you well and you will likely get many years of use out of one.  Wearing a heavy leather<br>
        boot will also help to keep hot metal from burning through other materials and reaching<br>
        your feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next piece of equipment that I will discuss is the forge itself.  You might wonder why this<br>
        is so far dow this list.  Part of that is because there are so many different ways to go about<br>
        either buying or building your own.  The two most common fuel sources are going to be coal<br>
        and propane.  Depending on where you live coal might be reasonably easy to come by but just<br>
        about everyone should have access to propane.  I've chosen to use propane for ease of use.<br>
        I did my research on coal and even applaud those that are able to use it consistently<br>
        because it is not an easy skill to learn.  Coal can burn much hotter than propane and thus<br>
        have an increased potential to damage the steel that you are working on.  Propane on the other<br>
        hand burns plenty hot enough to forge weld if needed but usually not so hot as to start burning<br>
        the carbon out of the steel.  There are numerous forges available to purchase online and I<br>
        chose a two burner to get started with.  While a single burner would have probably been fine<br>
        to get started with I knew that I would want a little more flexibility and have the extra<br>
        length available.
